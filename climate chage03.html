                <h3>20 September 2023, United Nations Headquarters, New York</h3>
                <p >Against the backdrop of the worsening climate crisis, the UN Secretary-General’s
                    Climate Ambition Summit aimed to showcase “first mover and doer” leaders from 
                    government, business, finance, local authorities, and civil society who came 
                    with credible actions, policies and plans – and not just pledges – to accelerate 
                    the decarbonization of the global economy and deliver climate justice in line with 
                    his Acceleration Agenda.
                   “If these first-doers and first-movers can do it, everybody can do it,” the 
                   Secretary-General said in his closing remarks, calling it a “Summit of Hope.”<br></p>
                   <p>By demonstrating that tangible and ambitious action to credibly cut emissions and 
                   deliver climate justice was possible and practical, the Summit showcased a way 
                   forward: the alignment of sectoral, local, national and international plans and 
                   policies with credible and scienced-backed targets to accelerate decarbonization, 
                   advance climate justice and fairness, with unprecedented levels of coordination and 
                   cooperation, and a renewed focus on credibility and accountability.
               </p>
               <h3>Three tracks</h3><hr>
    <p>The design and outcomes of the Summit will be delivered on three distinct but 
        interrelated acceleration tracks – ambition, credibility and implementation.</p>
        <p></p>
    <h3>Ambition</h3>
    <P>Government leaders (especially major emitters) will be expected to present updated 
        pre-2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (as agreed in Glasgow); updated net-zero 
        targets; energy transition plans with commitments to no new coal, oil and gas; fossil 
        fuel phase-out plans; more ambitious renewable-energy targets; Green Climate Fund pledges; 
        and economy-wide plans on adaptation and resilience. Finally, all main emitters and notably 
        all G20 governments will be asked to commit to presenting, by 2025, more ambitious economy-wide 
        Nationally Determined Contributions featuring absolute emissions cuts and covering all gases.</P>
        <h3>Credibility</h3>
        <p>Leaders of businesses, cities, regions and financial institutions will be expected to present transition plans aligned with the UN-backed credibility standard presented in the “Integrity Matters” report commissioned by the UN Secretary-General. This standard for voluntary net-zero pledges is the only existing one fully aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C degrees. It calls for 2025 and 2030 targets, coverage of scope 3 emissions, just transition plans to stop and phase out fossil fuels, actual emissions cuts without using offsets, and a commitment to publicly advocate for science-based climate action.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>Leaders of governments, international and regional organizations and financial institutions, the private sector and civil society will present existing or emerging implementation partnerships addressing challenges and opportunities related to accelerating the decarbonization of high-emitting sectors (energy, shipping, aviation, steel, cement) or on delivering climate justice (reform of the international financial system, early warning systems, adaptation, loss and damage).</p>
        <h3>UN Climate Change Conferences</h3>
        <p>Every year, countries who have joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meet to measure progress and negotiate multilateral responses to climate change. Today there are 198 Parties to the Convention.</p>
        <p>The UNFCCC is a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992 – shortly after the first assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 – to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system.”</p>
        <p>Since entering into force in 1994, the UNFCCC has provided the basis for international climate negotiations, including landmark agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015).</p>
        <p>The first Conference of the Parties (COP) was held in Berlin, Germany, in 1995. The 28th COP will be held at the end of 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It will include the first Global Stocktake, where States assess the progress made towards the goals set in the Paris Agreement and chart a course of action.</p>
