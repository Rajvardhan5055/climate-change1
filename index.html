                <h3>What Is Climate Change?</h3>
                <!-- Add YouTube video embed code here -->
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in 
                    temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts
                    can be natural, 
                    due to changes in the sun’s activity or 
                    large volcanic eruptions. But since the 
                    1800s, human activities have
                    been the main driver of climate change, 
                    primarily due to the burning of fossil 
                    fuels like coal, oil and gas.
            
                    Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse 
                    gas emissions that act like a blanket 
                    wrapped around the Earth, 
                    trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
                    
                    The main greenhouse gases that are causing 
                    climate change include carbon dioxide and methane.
                    These come
                    from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for
                    heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting
                    down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture
                    ,oil and gas operations are major sources of methane
                    emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings,
                    agriculture and land use are among the main sectors
                    causing greenhouse gases.</p>

                    <h3>Humans are responsible for global warming</h3>
                    <p>Climate scientists have showed that humans are 
                        responsible for virtually all global heating 
                        over the last 200 years. Human activities like 
                        the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse 
                        gases that are warming the world faster than at 
                        any time in at least the last two thousand years.
                
                        The average temperature of the Earth’s surface 
                        is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 
                        late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) 
                        and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 
                        years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest
                        on record, and each of the last four decades has 
                        been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.
                        
                        Many people think climate change mainly means 
                        warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is 
                        only the beginning of the story. Because the 
                        Earth is a system, where everything is connected
                        , changes in one area can influence changes
                         in all others.
                        
                        The consequences of climate change now include, 
                        among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, 
                        severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting 
                        polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>

                        <h3>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h3>
                        <p>In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists 
                            and government reviewers agreed that limiting global 
                            temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help 
                            us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a 
                            livable climate. Yet policies currently in place 
                            point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
                
                            The emissions that cause climate change come from 
                            every part of the world and affect everyone, but some 
                            countries produce much more than others.The seven 
                            biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of America,
                            India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian 
                            Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all 
                            global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
                            
                            Everyone must take climate action, but people and 
                            countries creating more of the problem have a greater 
                            responsibility to act first.</p>
                            <img src="image 3.jpg" height="280px" width="500px" >
                            <h3>We face a huge challenge but already know many solutions</h3>
                            <p>Many climate change solutions can deliver economic 
                                benefits while improving our lives and protecting 
                                the environment. We also have global frameworks and 
                                agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable
                                Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on 
                                Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad 
                                 categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting 
                                 to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.
                
                                Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables 
                                like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving
                                climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing 
                                number of countries is committing to net zero emissions
                                by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep 
                                warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this means huge declines
                                in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of 
                                today’s proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept 
                                in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic 
                                levels of climate change.</p>

                                <h3>We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future</h3>
                                <p>Climate action requires significant financial investments 
                                    by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is 
                                    vastly more expensive. One critical step is for 
                                    industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to 
                                    provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so 
                                    they can adapt and move toward greener economies.</p>
