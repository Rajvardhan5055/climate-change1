                <ul type="squale">
                    <li><b>Sustainable Development Goals</b></li>
                    <h4>The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for 
                        action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-
                        income – to promote prosperity while protecting 
                        the planet. They recognize that ending poverty 
                        must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build 
                        economic growth and address a range of social needs 
                        including education, health, social protection and 
                        job opportunities, while tackling climate change 
                        and environmental protectionOf the 17 goals, number 
                        13 calls for urgent action 
                       to combat climate change and its impacts. But all 
                       of the goals influence climate change – and vice 
                       versa. We will make little progress on climate action 
                       without accelerating achievement of Goal 7 on 
                       affordable and clean energy, for instance, or Goal 
                       12 on responsible consumption and production. Climate 
                       solutions can support the goals such as through a 
                       just transition to renewable energy centred on providing 
                       decent work, the focus of Goal 8, or through developing 
                       resilient in frastructure under Goal 9.</h4>

                    <h4>Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge – and key to the solution
                        A large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth 
                        and trap the sun’s heat are generated through energy production, 
                        by burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat.
                        To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and
                         invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, 
                         affordable, sustainable, and reliable

                        initiatives to speed up the pace of climate action. Initiated at 
                        the 2019 Climate Action Summit held at the United Nations, the 
                        initiatives below are reducing emissions, tackling critical concerns 
                        such as jobs and gender equality, unlocking finance, building sustainable 
                        infrastructure, using nature-based solutions, and advancing adaptation and 
                        climate resilience.

                        The United Nations’ role as a convener is needed more than ever to 
                        encourage all sectors to collaborate, be ambitious and take actions 
                        required to tackle the climate crisis and  transition to a sustainable, 
                        low-carbon economy that is just and beneficial for all people.</h4>
